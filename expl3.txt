This map has slightly different words for exits (and shows that multiple
names can refer to the same exit just to make game play easier);
the objective is to collect things, although you need to kill something
first (unless you are very lucky).

Oh and there are some one-way doors, and if you visit the rooms in the 
wrong order you get trapped.
